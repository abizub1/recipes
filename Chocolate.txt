Chocolate
Ingredients
Milk - 150ml (2/3 of a cup)
Cocoa powder - 220g (2 cups)
Butter - 160g (3/4 of a cup)
Water - 230ml (1 cup)
Flour - 30g (1/4 of a cup)
Sugar -120g (1/2 of a cup) - if possible use powdered sugar
1. Take 220g (2 cups) of coca powder (make sure you take as finer powder you can find, look at the picture) and put them in a bowl. Take 160g (3/4 of a cup) of butter and put them in bowl containing the cocoa powder. Using a spoon grind bigger pieces of cocoa powder. I recommend chopping the butter in smaller pieces for easier processing. Put the contents of the bowl in a blender or a food processor and blend them into a fine paste.
2. Put 230ml (1 cup) of water in a pot and put the paste you made in previous step in it. Heat it up until its hot, but not boiling. Put the fluid back in the bowl and add 150ml (2/3 of a cup) of milk , 30g (1/4 of a cup) of flour and 120g (1/2 of a cup) of sugar in while it hot. Put the mass in a food proccessor or mix it by hand until you get rid of the lumps.
3. put in ice cube tray and refrigerate
